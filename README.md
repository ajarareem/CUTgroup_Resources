City Tech Collaborative's Civic User Testing group Resources


Background
--------
The Civic User Testing group, also known as CUTgroup, originated in Chicago to enable residents to give valuable input throughout the technology discovery and development process, allowing them to have a voice in emerging technology. CUTgroup’s model combines User Experience (UX) testing, civic engagement, and digital skills training to provide a unique perspective for technological solutions. Over its lifetime, Chicago’s CUTgroup has provided input in over 30 different local user design exercises for civic and government-related products.

Chicago's CUTgroup was most recently led by City Tech Collaborative, following a merger between City Digital and the Smart Chicago Collaborative in 2017. At the end of 2021, [City Tech launched two new, independent organizations](https://www.citytech.org/city-tech-launches-two-new-organizations-and-open-source-toolkit) focused on [civic infrastructure innovation](https://www.infrastructureforward.org/) and [community health and wellness](https://www.sustainwellinnovation.org/) and closed it doors. With this update, City Tech wanted to share its CUTgroup resources for others to utilize for their own Civic User Testing programs. 

This site serves to document CUTgroup materials and resources developed by City Tech Collaborative. They represent one approach to Civic User Testing, influenced by the [CUTgroup Book](https://www.cutgroupbook.com/) by Daniel X. O’Neil and the Smart Chicago Collaborative and adjusted to fit City Tech's work in this space. Along with these materials, we encourage you to explore the original CUTgroup book, as well as what other organizations are doing within this space.


Usage
